cw shell - Clockwork Shell
==========================

The Clockwork shell allows you to poke around a manifest,
inspecting resources, policies and hosts.  It lets you load
arbitrary sets of facts and see how the manifest will react
(what resources are defined, what values are assigned to
attributes, etc.)

cw shell is part of Clockwork, a Configuration Management System
that enforces configuration policies on any number of host
systems.  For more information, see clockwork(7).
