Developing for Clockwork
------------------------

So you want to hack on Clockwork, eh?

Well, you're in luck.  I have looked at far too much open source
code that is a pain in the a** to dive into, with cryptic and
undocumented build systems.  I vowed long ago not to repeat that
mistake.




1. TOOLS YOU WILL NEED
----------------------

A Linux Development Environment

  Clockwork does not (at this time) support any platform other
  than Linux.  If you are interested in *porting* Clockwork to
  another platform, I'll gladly accept patches.

  Otherwise, get a Linux box to develop on.  I strongly urge
  you to get a dedicated machine (it can be a virtual machine)
  to do your testing on.  As a configuration management system,
  Clockwork needs root access and with root access, bugs can
  wreak some serious havok on your build box.

An ANSI C99-compliant C compiler

  The policy master and agent components are written entirely in
  ANSI C99 C (at least its *supposed* to be ANSI C99).  The build
  environment uses several GCC-specific flags to catch code errors.

  I personally use GCC 4.4.3 out of the Ubunut repositories

Supporting Library Development Headers

  Clockwork currently relies on the following 3rd party libraries:

  - Augeas          Used by several resources for config file mods
  - SQLite3         For the reporting database backend
  - OpenSSL         Provides the TLS security later

Supporting Software Development Tools

  The Clockwork build system relies on the following auxiliary
  tools to do its job:

  - GNU Flex/Bison   For config / manifest / template parsers
  - GCOV / LCOV      Code coverage profiler with HTML reports
  - Perl             Functional test suite is written entirely in Perl




2. SETTING UP THE ENVIRONMENT
-----------------------------

To get started, you'll want to configure your build environment.
If you run the ./configure script with the --development flag,
Clockwork will generate a Makefile component in ./config with
all the settings you will need to compile with profiling and
debugging support.

  $ ./configure --development
  ===================================
  Clockwork will be built as follows:

  Environment: development

  User:  clockwork
  Group: clockwork

  DESTDIR: /

  SBINDIR: /sbin
  VARDIR:  /var/clockwork
  ETCDIR:  /etc/clockwork
  MANDIR:  /usr/share/man

  Build agent tools?    [ Y ]
  Build master tools?   [ Y ]

  ===================================
  configuration saved to ./config

(or something like that).

You can ignore the path variables (SBINDIR, VARDIR, etc.) for now;
unless you issue a `make install', they will remain unused.

You can get a full summary of the build configuration by issuing:

  $ ./configure --show

More technical detail is given by:

  $ make summary

3. CONTRIBUTING PATCHES
-----------------------

If you have worked up a bugfix or feature-enhancement patch for Clockwork,
email it to me.  The only thing I ask is that you:

 1. Use `diff -u -C5' to generate the patch

 2. Include test cases to exercise your code

 3. Describe your changes in the body of your email
    (not in the comments, unless necessary)

 4. Explicitly license your code under a BSD or MIT license.
