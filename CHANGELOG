Release Notes for Clockwork


v2.3.0 - 2014-09-11

  * New `cw' multi-call binary to replace cw* tools into a single,
    user-extensible sub-command dispather, a la git.

    The following utilities have therefore been renamed:

       cwcc     ->  cw-cc
       fact     ->  cw-fact
       cwtrust  ->  cw-trust
       cwpol    ->  cw-shell
       cwkey    ->  cw-cert
       cw-run   ->  cw-mesh (and cw-show, cw-ping, etc.)

       cwtool   ->  cw-localsys [internal to cogd]

   * cw-mesh prompting is now done to stderr, for pipelines
   * cw-mesh now ignores nodes that optout by default
     (use --optout to retain the legacy behavior)
   * cw-mesh now honors ~/.cwrc as an adjunct to /etc/clockwork/cw.conf
