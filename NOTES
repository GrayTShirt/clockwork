Locking System Accounts
-----------------------
User account locking seems to be accomplished via the standard passwd(1)
command by placing an exclamation point (!, 0x21) immediately before the
encrypted password in the /etc/shadow file.  Unlocking is done by removing
this exclamation point.  This method seems to be preferred because it
allows sysads to lock an account without losing the original password.
