Locking System Accounts
-----------------------
User account locking seems to be accomplished via the standard passwd(1)
command by placing an exclamation point (!, 0x21) immediately before the
encrypted password in the /etc/shadow file.  Unlocking is done by removing
this exclamation point.  This method seems to be preferred because it
allows sysads to lock an account without losing the original password.

PWDB / SPDB - Remove List Head
------------------------------
Removing the list head (first entry in the database) currently presents a
few problems.  The caller has a pointer to the entry structure, so
stitching it out of the picture does not work.

Perhaps the best bet is to go back to pointers for payload (either struct
passwd * or struct spwd *) and set the pointer to NULL for all deleted
payloads (and free()ing memory accordingly).  Of course, the documentation
will have to warn callers that the second parameter passed to the pwdb_rm()
function will be freed, so that future usage results in undefined behavior.

SOLVED: The passwd member of struct pwdb is now a pointer
