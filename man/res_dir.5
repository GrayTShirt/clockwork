res_dir \- Clockwork Resource Type for system directories

the presence of directories and the permissions on them.

be managed.

The name or UID of the user who should own the directory.

\"----------------------------------------------------------------
.SH EXAMPLES

.SS Basic Usage
The following policy configuration would create /srv/www, and
make it readable, writable and traversable by the apache user
(for running Apache) and the web group (people who manage the
code and content of web sites).
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
directory "/srv/www" {
    owner: "apache"
    group: "web"
    mode:  "0775"
}
.fi
.RE
.PP


\"----------------------------------------------------------------
.SH CAVEATS

.SS 1. Parent Directories
Directory resources do not currently create parent directories.
.PP

.SS 2. UID / GID Support
Even though the documentation above says that the \fBowner\fR and
\fBgroup\fR attributes can be set to either a name or an ID, the
system only works with names.  IDs will be ignored, as if the ID
was 0.
.PP

\"----------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DEPENDENCIES
Directory resources implicitly create the following dependencies:
.PP
.SS User Owner (owner)
If the
.B owner
attribute is specified, the directory resource will depend on the
existence of that user.  This is designed to ensure that directories
are owned by valid system users.
.PP

.SS Group Owner (group)
If the
.B group
attribute is specified, the directory resource will depend on the
existence of that group.  This is designed to ensure that directories
are owned by valid system groups.
.PP

\"----------------------------------------------------------------
.SH AUTHOR

.PP
Original ideas were stolen from
.B CFEngine
(Mark Burgess) and

(Luke Kanies).

.SH BUGS
