.B Clockwork
is a system configuration management system designed to securely enforce
policies on one or more host systems.  It can ensure that files have the
prescribed attributes (owner, group, permissions, etc.) and content.  It
can maintain a specific set of installed packages, and even make sure that
system user accounts exist.
