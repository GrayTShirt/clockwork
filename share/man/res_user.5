\"----------------------------------------------------------------
.SH NAME
res_user \- Clockwork Resource Type for system users
.br

\"----------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
The user resource manages system user accounts.

\"----------------------------------------------------------------
.SH ATTRIBUTES

.B uid
.RS 8
Numeric user ID of this account.
.RE
.PP

.B username
.RS 8
The username for this account.
.RE
.PP

.B gid
.RS 8
Numeric group ID for this acount's primary group.
.RE
.PP

.B home
.RS 8
Path to this user's home directory.  This attribute only sets
the home directory path in /etc/password.  To create home directories
for new users, see the \fBmakehome\fR / \fRskeleton\fB attribute.
.RE
.PP

.B present
.RS 8
Whether or not this account should exist on the system.
.RE
.PP

.B locked
.RS 8
Whether or not this account should be locked and therefore unable
to log in.  Locking an account does not destroy password information;
a locked account can be unlocked later and the original password will
work.
.RE
.PP

.B comment
.br
.B gecos
.RS 8
A comment describing the purpose of this account, commonly refered to
as the GECOS field.  See \fBpasswd\fR(5) for more details.
.PP
Clockwork does not attempt to interpret the GECOS field like the
\fBchfn\fR(1) utility does.
.RE
.PP

.B shell
.RS 8
The path to the login shell for this account.  No validation is done
on this shell, since specifying non-existent or unapproved login shells
is one way of locking accounts out of a system.
.RE
.PP

.B password
.br
.B pwhash
.RS 8
The (encrypted) password for this account.  Details of encryption depend
on the specific platform and system configuration.  Clockwork does not
attempt to encrypt or decrypt passwords for users.
.RE
.PP

.B pwmin
.RS 8
Minimum number of days between password changes.
.RE
.PP

.B pwmax
.RS 8
Maximum age of the account password (in days).
.RE
.PP

.B pwwarn
.RS 8
Number of days before the password expires (according to \fBpwmax\fR)
to start warning the user that they should change their password.
.RE
.PP

.B inact
.RS 8
Number of days after the password expires (according to \fBpwmax\fR)
before the account is reversibly disabled.
.RE
.PP

.B expiry
.br
.B expiration
.RS 8
When the account expires.  This value is specified as the number of days
since Jan 1, 1970, and is not related to the \fBpwmax\fR, \fBpwmin\fR or
\fBinact\fR attributes.
.RE
.PP

.B skeleton
.br
.B makehome
.RS 8
This attribute enables home directory creation for new users.  Valid values
include "yes", "no" or a path to a skeleton directory.  If "yes" is used,
then the system default of /etc/skel is used as a template to create the
new home directory.  Otherwise, the path given is used.
.PP
Home directory creation is only effective if the account does not already
exist on the local system; Clockwork will not overwrite or otherwise meddle
with a pre-existing home directory.
.PP
See the \fBEXAMPLES\fR section for more information.

.SH EXAMPLES

.SS Removing and Locking Accounts
To remove a user account:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
user "jim" {
    present: "no"
}
.fi
.RE
.PP
To keep the account around (including its original password),
but deny any and all login access to it:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
user "jim" {
    locked: "yes"
}
.fi
.RE
.PP

.SS Password Expiration
The following example implements a password expiration policy:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
user "eva" {
  pwmin:  1   # After password change, user must
              # wait at least 1 day to change their
              # password again.

  pwmax:  45  # Passwords *must* be changed after
              # 45 days.

  pwwarn: 10  # Warn the user 10 days before their
              # password expires that they will have
              # to change it soon.  Under normal
              # circumstances, this will be 35 days
              # after they change it.

  inact:  5   # Give the users 5 days after their
              # password expires (50 days after they
              # change it) before disabling the
              # account.
}
.fi
.RE
.PP
If you specify password aging parameters, make sure you don't also set
the account password via the \fBpassword\fR / \fBpwhash\fR attributes.
.PP

.SS Creating Home Directories
The user resource can create the home directory for newly created
users if the \fBmakehome\fR or \fBskeleton\fR attributes are set.
.PP
Create the user "bob", and model his home directory after /etc/skel:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
user "bob" {
    uid:      1006
    gid:      1001   # users, defined elsewhere
    home:     "/home/guests/bob"
    makehome: "yes"
}
.fi
.RE
.PP
If you want to use a different skeleton directory (i.e. for system
administrator accounts), specify its path in the \fBmakehome\fR
attribute:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
user "james" {
  uid:       7001,
  gid:       1002,   # admins, defined elsewhere
  home:      "/home/james"
  makehome:  "/etc/skel.admin"
}
.fi
.RE
.PP
.B Note:
The \fBmakehome\fR and \fBskeleton\fR attributes are synonymous.
The last example is probably more clearly expressed as:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
user "james" {
  uid:       7001,
  gid:       1002,   # admins, defined elsewhere
  home:      "/home/james"
  skeleton:  "/etc/skel.admin"
}
.fi
.RE
.PP


\"----------------------------------------------------------------
.SH CAVEATS

.SS 1. Passwords are Forever
If an encrypted password is supplied, it will always be enforced
for the user.  It is therefore impossible to specify a password
to be used only upon initial creation of the account.  If one is
given, and the user subsequently changes their password, Clockwork
will change it back.
.PP
That being said, setting passwords through Clockwork is discouraged,
and other avenues of granting access (like SSH public / private
keys) is encouraged.
.PP

.SS 2. Removing Home Directories
Clockwork does not remove a user's home directory when it removes
the account.  This is by design, to ensure that important data
is not lost when users depart.  If you want to remove the home
directory, use \fBres_file\fR(5) in concert with \fBres_user\fR.
.PP

.SS 3. Dependencies
For flexibility's sake, Clockwork does not create implicit dependencies
on users for  their primary group.  If you specify that a user's primary GID
should be 177, Clockwork will happily comply, even if there is no group
defined on the system (either through policy or externally) with that GID.
.PP
This should not break normal operation of the system, but it will lead to
some strangeness when dealing with files owned by that user.
.PP
