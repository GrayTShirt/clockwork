List of Things To Do
====================

Client / Server
     Communication between cwcert and cwca
       More intrusive signing / verification procedure
       Auto-cert generation
          use /etc/clockwork/cert.conf if it exists
       Auto-cert validation (cwca not necessary?)

       Better SSL error messages (bad ca, revoked, expired, etc.)
       How to handle unknown CA on first connect?
          error message + reminder that admin must install CA cert

Better diagnostics, server-side
IPv6 support (Protocol-agnostic, preferably)

Add check for database availability / creation in policyd -t / cwa
Default host support
Regular Expression support in manifest definition
Document custom fact creation

Portability Items
=================

gshadow support - Rewrite internally (still not POSIX)
