TODO
====

  - document pendulum 2 assembler code
    (maybe embed in opcodes.yml?)
  - man page for pcov (and probably updates for pn)
  - relocatable addresses?
    (constant strings would need to be merged somehow)
    benefit: coverage of *just* stdlib.pn during tests
    alt: object boundaries via asm opcode (border?)
         it would have to be a special
  - make fn redefinition emit a warning
  - suppress auto-RET if last op is a BAIL
  - handle missing stdlib better
  - go through call tree in general and handle errors
  - better logging
  - update vim syntax files
  - fix mesh
