TODO
====

  - t/8x-stdlib.t - Tests for standard library functionality
    (in a clean environment; should support coverage reports)
  - document pendulum 2 assembler code
    (maybe embed in opcodes.yml?)
  - man page for pcov (and probably updates for pn)
  - 'include' directive, to keep files/line numbers sorted out during asm
  - relocatable addresses?
    (constant strings would need to be merged somehow)
    benefit: coverage of *just* stdlib.pn during tests
    alt: object boundaries via asm opcode (border?)
         it would have to be a special
  - make fn redefinition emit a warning
  - expand 0xfe opcode: [fe] [xx] <string> [00]
    - `pn -Sg` will inject these annotations
    - `pn -d` will print them
    - `pcov --html` will make use of them
    - support the following types ([xx] byte)
      - file/line annotations (xx = 01)
      - comments (xx = 02)
      - function name annotations (xx = 03)
      - module annotations (xx = 04)
