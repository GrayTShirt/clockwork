List of Things To Do
====================

Re-org test/:
  test/memory/         -> source / object files for auxiliary memory tests
  test/memory/data     -> data for auxiliary memory tests
  test/memory/reports  -> valgrind/memcheck transcripts from aux mem tests
  test/memory/run      -> auxiliary memory test runner

Re-org Make targets for tests:
  auxmem      -> build / run auxiliary memory tests only
+ test        -> build / run unit, functional and auxiliary memory tests
+ memtest     -> same as test, but run unit and functional tests under valgrind

  The unit, functional and auxmem targets will also have a build_*
  variant for building the executables needed to run their respecitve tests

Variable Strings for Attribute Values

Client / Server
  - Test remediation in chroot
  - Automatic certificate enrolment

     cwcert - CSR tool for agents
       Implement 'renew'

     Communication between cwcert and cwca
       More intrusive signing / verification procedure
       How to handle renewals / revocation?

chroot testing
  Need to be able to run full-sim tests in chroot environments,
  so that functional tests can be reproduced, without requiring
  specific build machine system changes, or root access.

  mkjail is done.  To do this right, we need passphrase-less
  certificates, and very long expirations (i.e. 100 years).

Logo / Branding
  Get the logo drawn and vectorized.  Determine what legal stuff
  needs to happen for Trademarks, Copyright etc.

Website
  Need an overall design workup, in addition to ideas for content.

Infrastructure
  Identify needs for bug tracking, community support (forums, mailing
  lists, etc.) and collaborative development (i.e. ReviewBoard).
