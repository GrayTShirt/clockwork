List of Things To Do
====================

Policy Explorer -
  shell-like interface to the in-memory representation of
  a policy manifest.  Invaluable to sys admins for testing
  and troubleshooting purposes.

  If we could modify the policy master to store the facts
  it receives from the clients, they can be fed back into
  the policy explorer to see how a policy change will
  affect live systems.

  Example session:
  $ cwpol /path/to/manifest.pol
  Clockwork Policy Explorer vX.Y.Z
  Reading in /path/to/manifest.pol

  top> show hosts
  jade.niftylogic.net
  rd.niftylogic.net

  top> show policy
  base
  testing
  web-server

  top> use policy base
  !! No facts have been defined

  top> show facts
  (none defined)

  top> read facts from /path/to/static/file
  static.fact1 = "This is my fact"

  top> clear facts
  top> gather facts from /path/to/facts.d/*.sh
  sys.fqdn = "hostname.domain"
  lsb.distro = "Ubuntu"

  top> show facts like lsb.
  lsb.distro = "Ubuntu"

  top> fact lsb.distro = "Debian"
  lsb.distro = "Debian"

  top> show facts
  sys.fqdn = "hostname.domain"
  lsb.distro = "Debian"

  top> use policy base
  /p/base> show resources
  file: /etc/tmp1
  file: /etc/tmp2
  user: jrhunt

  /p/base> show user resources
  user: jrhunt

  /p/base> show user:jrhunt
  user "jrhunt" {
    uid: 1001
    gid: 1002
    home: "/home/jrhunt"
  }

  /p/base> exit
  $

Tests for cert.o module
cwdb for Database Reporting (cwreport?) - IN PROGRESS


Client / Server
  - Test remediation in chroot
  - Automatic certificate enrolment

     cwcert - CSR tool for agents
       Implement 'renew'

     Communication between cwcert and cwca
       More intrusive signing / verification procedure
       How to handle renewals / revocation?

chroot testing
  Need to be able to run full-sim tests in chroot environments,
  so that functional tests can be reproduced, without requiring
  specific build machine system changes, or root access.

  mkjail is done.  To do this right, we need passphrase-less
  certificates, and very long expirations (i.e. 100 years).

Logo / Branding
  Get the logo drawn and vectorized.  Determine what legal stuff
  needs to happen for Trademarks, Copyright etc.

Website
  Need an overall design workup, in addition to ideas for content.

Infrastructure
  Identify needs for bug tracking, community support (forums, mailing
  lists, etc.) and collaborative development (i.e. ReviewBoard).
