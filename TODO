List of Things To Do
====================

autostr implementation as standalone
Variable Strings for Attribute Values

res_file -> parent-directory implicit dependencies
Figure out how to manage parts of a file (like augeas)
  - Instead of resources like res_mount, what if integrate
    augeas under the stanza type of "config":

        policy "test" {
              config "sshd" {
                  path: "/etc/ssh/sshd_config"   # file path
                  type: "sshd_config"            # lense to use
                  data {                         # config data
                        set Protocol 2

                        set SyslogFacility AUTH
                        set LogLevel       INFO

                        set PermitRootLogin no
                  }
              }
              config("sshd") affects service("sshd")
        }

Tests for cert.o module

cwdb for Database Reporting (cwreport?) - IN PROGRESS

Client / Server
  - Test remediation in chroot
  - Automatic certificate enrolment

     cwcert - CSR tool for agents
       Implement 'renew'

     Communication between cwcert and cwca
       More intrusive signing / verification procedure
       How to handle renewals / revocation?

chroot testing
  Need to be able to run full-sim tests in chroot environments,
  so that functional tests can be reproduced, without requiring
  specific build machine system changes, or root access.

  mkjail is coming along.  To do this right, we need passphrase-less
  certificates, and very long expirations (i.e. 100 years).

More resources
  Check the RESOURCE file for the most up-to-date information.

Logo / Branding
  Get the logo drawn and vectorized.  Determine what legal stuff
  needs to happen for Trademarks, Copyright etc.

Website
  Need an overall design workup, in addition to ideas for content.

Infrastructure
  Identify needs for bug tracking, community support (forums, mailing
  lists, etc.) and collaborative development (i.e. ReviewBoard).
