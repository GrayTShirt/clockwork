TODO
====

  - t/8x-stdlib.t - Tests for standard library functionality
    (in a clean environment)
  - document pendulum 2 assembler code
    (maybe embed in opcodes.yml?)
  - Pendulum Code Coverage reporting
      `pn --cover program.S`
        Run program.S, and write a coverage file to program.pcov
      `pcov program.S`
        Read program.pcov, disassemble program.S, and show opcode
        hit counts per offset / total % of opcodes hit
        (might be written in Perl)
