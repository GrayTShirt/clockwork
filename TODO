List of Things To Do
====================

Tests for mem.o module

Client / Server
  - Test remediation in chroot
  - Automatic certificate enrolment

     cwcert - CSR tool for agents
       Implement 'renew'

     cwca   - CA tool for policy masters
       Finish 'new'
       Implement 'revoke'

     Communication between cwcert and cwca
       More intrusive signing / verification procedure
       How to handle renewals / revocation?
       How to handle serial number generation?

API documentation
  Use some sort of source-code documentation system (Doxygen)
  to build up a readable but succinct body of function docs
  and library usage information (i.e. how do I use a stringlist?)

chroot testing
  Need to be able to run full-sim tests in chroot environments,
  so that functional tests can be reproduced, without requiring
  specific build machine system changes, or root access.

  mkjail is coming along.  To do this right, we need passphrase-less
  certificates, and very long expirations (i.e. 100 years).

man pages / documentation - STARTED
  Write man pages for policyd, cwa and clockwork in general.

Reporting
  Design and implement the reporting generation, submission,
  storage and analysis parts.  Might want to look into database
  backends.

More resources
  Check the RESOURCE file for the most up-to-date information.
  Definitely need to implement res_package and res_service.

VIm syntax rules
  Write a syntax definition for the daemon / client configuration
  files, and one for the manifest definitions.  For the config
  syntax, make sure that all keywords are highlighted properly,
  to aid administrators in configuration.

Logo / Branding
  Get the logo drawn and vectorized.  Determine what legal stuff
  needs to happen for Trademarks, Copyright etc.

Website
  Need an overall design workup, in addition to ideas for content.

Infrastructure
  Identify needs for bug tracking, community support (forums, mailing
  lists, etc.) and collaborative development (i.e. ReviewBoard).
