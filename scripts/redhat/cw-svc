# USAGE: cw-svc <action> <name>
#
# The following actions must be defined:
#
#   run-status SVC    Determine whether or not the service is
#                     running (per LSB semantics).
#
#                       exit 0    = service is running
#                       otherwise = service is not running
#                                   or has other init-script
#                                   issues (dead locks, no
#                                   PID file, etc.)
#
#   boot-status SVC   Determine whether or not the service is
#                     set to be started on boot (runlevel 3)
#
#                       exit 0    = service starts at boot
#                       otherwise = service is off by default
#
#   start SVC         Start the (stopped) service
#
#                       exit 0    = service started successfully
#                       otherwise = failed to start
#
#   stop SVC          Stop the (running) service
#
#                       exit 0    = service stopped successfully
#                       otherwise = failed to stop
#
#   enable SVC        Set the service to start on boot (runevel 3)
#
#                       exit 0    = service enabled at boot
#                       otherwise = failure
#
#   disable SVC       Keep the service from starting at boot
#
#                       exit 0    = service won't start at boot
#                       otherwise = failure
#
# Any unrecognized commands should return exit code 125.
